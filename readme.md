This is the frontend package for the Hourai Teahouse website.  Thus far it was written with a "get pieces working" mindset rather than a proper design/plan and thus it requires significant UI/UX work to be public-ready.

This is a standard Angular setup.  To run it locally, use your choice of method (http-server on WebContent directory, nginx config, whatever).
Sample nginx config has been provided.
Make sure to update the port # in app.js as appropriate for how you're running the backend.

Major TODOs and Milestones:
- UI/UX work
- Build/bundle system
- Public release
- Additional features (wiki, issue tracker, etc)
